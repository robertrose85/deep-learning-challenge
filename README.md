## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
 The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data Preprocessing
* Targets: `IS_SUCCESSFUL`
* Features: `AFFILIATION`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `USE_CASE`, `ORGANIZATION`, `STATUS`, `INCOME_AMT`, `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`, `ASK_AMT`, `APPLICATION_TYPE`
* Removed Variables: `EIN` and `NAME`

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* 200, 100, 50 neurons
* 3 Hidden Layers and 1 Output layer.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* I was not able to achieve the target performance.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
* I added an extra layer, added neurons, and even changed up the model.
